# ll-techdegree-project-1 (V3)
 my first techdegree project - number guessing game


It's a great learning practice.
Actually doing the coding, testing the codes, google around - these processes are so meanful and interesting.

after the first review:

- revised the feedback wordings so that users will not be confused;

- added the option of resuming game when user accidentally inputs the invalid value;
whenever the user inputs an invalid value or out of range number, the user got an option of "resume game",
and the guess_count will not be increased; the programm will loop the user back with the same round, same correct number;

- keeping learning and keep pushing forward.
